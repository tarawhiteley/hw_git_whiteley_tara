# Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

First, I could not just pick one animal for this project. Instead, I chose to highlight both of my pets because I can't pick a favorite!

Second, I used a validator for both my html and css files. I would like to make you aware of some errors I received that I don't believe are true errors.

- On my index.html file, I received an error for the way I linked to my Google fonts in the ``<head>`` tag. This is how the new Google fonts site provides the links, which is different from the way we used to get the font files from Google. Previously, we would get the links for each font one at a time. However, now Google loads them into something similar to a package and provides the appropriate coding for the package of fonts.

- On my main.css file, I used gradients for my background colors for the page and the content boxes. I received similar errors for both of those gradient codes. Just as a reminder, using this gradient was the topic of an email we had prior to assignment submission. I imagine these error messages are what you were referring to in those emails about it generating more code than is needed. And while I understand using this gradient generator is not ideal, I appreciate you giving me permission to use it in this assignment.
