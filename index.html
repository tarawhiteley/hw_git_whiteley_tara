        <p>There is no doubt about which animals are my favorites. My dog, Chief, and my cat, Mojo, have been by my side for 12 and 15 years respectively.</p>

        <h3>Chief</h3>

        <p>Chief is a 12-year-old All American mix breed. She is truly my very best friend. She is named after a police chief who's dog snuck out and got pregnant unexpectedly. Some people think she's a male dog because of her name, but I just tell them that "Girls can be chiefs, too!" She loves to sniff around on our walks, go for drives, take swims and get ice cream treats from Bruster's Ice Cream. She likes riding in the car so much that she even joins me on the 600 mile drive to my hometown in Pennsylvania.</p>

        <h3>Mojo</h3>

        <img src="img/mojo.jpg" alt="Mojo" title="One of my favorite animals, Mojo" >

        <p>Mojo is a 15-year-old polydactyl cat, meaning he has extra toes on every paw! He is now old enough to be classifed as a geriatric cat but, other than not being able to jump on things like he used to, he hasn't slowed down or showed signs of being about 76 years old in human years. He loves to check out the neighboring yards near our home, and sleep on my lap when he's done exploring the outdoors.</p>
